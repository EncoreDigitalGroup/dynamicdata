# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /docs/ @doctocat

# will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
# /scripts/ @doctocat @octocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in a `/logs` directory such as
# `/build/logs`, `/scripts/logs`, and `/deeply/nested/logs`. Any changes
